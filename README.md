> Convex SaaS is an Open Source Template that is a direct port of the amazing
> work of [Daniel Kanem](https://twitter.com/DanielKanem) in [Remix SaaS](https://github.com/dev-xo/remix-saas).
> As that template does, this one shares common bits of code with: [Indie
> Stack](https://github.com/remix-run/indie-stack), [Epic
> Stack](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack), [Supa Stripe
> Stack](https://github.com/rphlmr/supa-stripe-stack), and some other amazing
> Open Source resources. Check them out, please!
